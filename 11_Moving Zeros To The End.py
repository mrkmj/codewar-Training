'''
Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

move_zeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) # returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]

ps：大坑啊
Test.assert_equals(move_zeros([1,2,0,1,0,1,0,3,0,1]),[ 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ])
Test.assert_equals(move_zeros([9,0.0,0,9,1,2,0,1,0,1,0.0,3,0,1,9,0,0,0,0,9]),[9,9,1,2,1,1,3,1,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
Test.assert_equals(move_zeros(["a",0,0,"b","c","d",0,1,0,1,0,3,0,1,9,0,0,0,0,9]),["a","b","c","d",1,1,3,1,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
Test.assert_equals(move_zeros(["a",0,0,"b",None,"c","d",0,1,False,0,1,0,3,[],0,1,9,0,0,{},0,0,9]),["a","b",None,"c","d",1,False,1,3,[],1,9,{},9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
Test.assert_equals(move_zeros([0,1,None,2,False,1,0]),[1,None,2,False,1,0,0])

要处理False，0.0……
